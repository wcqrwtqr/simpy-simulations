"""
The truck loading simulation is for simulating the number of trucks which are able to enter a loading station and get filled
with oil and leave, the simulation can get us a clear number of trucks that can be served at a given time and how increasing the number
of loading stations will affect the total of trucks each day.

The user can change the parameters such as number of stations and the speed of filling and see the results
